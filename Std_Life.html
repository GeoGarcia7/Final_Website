    <h2>Greetings! The University of Baguio Science High School welcomes you and 
	wants to ensure you that your student life throughout this high school is nothing short of exciting.
	Below are some of the activities that are held throughout the school year. The diversity of events
	allows students to have the chance to interact and socialize more. It also gives you the opportunity to
	immerse yourself along with your fellow scholars. Student life in UBSHS may sometimes be stressful and a 	
	little challenging, but that is the reason why you were qualified to enter the school. It only tells you 
	that you have the means and capabilities to overcome whatever requirements and activities you will have 
	to accomplish. One of the things that will get you through this school apart from the fun activities are
	the very kind, understanding and helpful faculty and staff. They also make sure that all the plans go 
	smoothly and work well as planned. Enjoy!

	<div style="color:black;font-size:40px;" class="overlay">The University of Baguio Science High School has a special event for whenever Christmas season comes. It's called the Christmas Cantata! This event
	is usually performed before the Christmas Parties. This is when everybody from freshmen to seniors are encouraged to participate since it only happens once a year and is also like a tradition
	for the school. The program consists of everyone singing together latin and english songs while the audience watches. This event wants to be seen by lots of people including students from other schools.
	The preparation takes about one and a half month during P.E time and specific time schedules throughout the week. On the day of the performance, we are given snacks since it usually takes up more than 3 hours. 
	The event lasts for 2-3 days</div>

	<div style="color:black;font-size:40px;" class="overlay">Immersion camp is one of what I consider to be my favorite event every other year. This is when we go to a place outside of Baguio on more remote areas that are less fortunate. It lasts up to 3 days and 2 nights.
	We camp on designated grounds helping each other get what we need. We wait for the food and we get to experience all sorts of activities. The main activitiy of this program is called Visit A Family. This where scholars get to go to the humble homes of families as we 
	prepare them food that is good for a day. This activity helps us experience and reflect on how we should appreciate the life we live everyday.</div>

	<div style="color:black;font-size:40px;" class="overlay">The YDT or Youth Development Training is one of the most awaited event evry school year. Each scholar is assigned to different teams competing against each other to get on top. There are six teeams in the high school division. Each team has their own
	unique chants, rhythmic cheers and surprises that are saved all for competition day. some are cheerers, steering committeees, props men and many more things you can join in. After this is the Sportsfest. A time to give those students who excel on sports a time to shine. 
	The most watched events based on observation would be basketball and volleyball especially championships against the seniors.</div>

	<div style="color:black;font-size:40px;" class="overlay">One of the most unique programs in this school would be the Anima Angelorum, A program considered to be sacred by the scholars because it is a time when you a fresh men meets his/her angel. An angel is a senior who acts as a guide, best buddy and 
	protector to the fresh man who is also known as the soul. This is a very fun and solemn program that helps cholars bond with their manongs and manangs as well.</div>

	<div style="color:black;font-size:40px;" class="overlay">This is one of those events that gives us time to breathe from our activities and projects. All classes participate and act as a team to decorate the classrooms accoridng to the assigned country. Everyone must have passports to travel and reach 
	other classrooms. Those who fail to acquire passports are then placed on the jail booth with a corresping amount of time. Each classroom prepares food that is famous in the country they have chosen which is fun and allows students to have a tasty travel experience.</div>

	<div style="color:black;font-size:40px;" class="overlay">Great Minds Meet is more of like the Battle of the Brains. Participants get to choose what activity they want to join in either in the field of math, science and many more. Winners get prizes, certificates, and sometimes trophies depending on the difficulty of the activity. 
	This activitiy shows that we are intelligent and smart in our own unique way. There are Quiz bees and my personal favorite, The Amazing Race, a race that allows students to rush to certain destinations and solving particular puzzles, cryptograms and others to win. This program does not only challenge 
	our brain mentally, but physically as well.
