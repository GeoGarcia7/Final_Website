    The UB Science High School was founded by Dr. Reinaldo C. Bautista Sr. 
	and can be considered as one of the pioneers of science education in the 
	country.A PACUCOA Accredited â€“ Level II academic community, Education 
	Service Contracting (ESC) participating school and Senior High School Voucher 
	Program recipient.		
   </p>
   
   <p class="paragraph">
    In 1963, up on graduating from the sixth grade, some students all over Baguio
	took a special test. The students who passed were put together in one class
	and was called the Special Science Scholars Section (SSSS).Since then, an annual
	scholarship exam was being administered for the best and the brightest pupils. 
	In 1967, the first batch of intellectually  gifted students graduated, it was 
	also the same year the UB Science High School was born. In 1970, the UB Science 
	High School received its legal recognition with Government 
	Recognition No. 151 s. 1970.
   </p>  

   <p class="paragraph">
    For more than six decades now, the culture of excellence of the school 
    continue, as it gained recognition as a consistent top performing school. 
    But beyond academic excellence, the school is a home of budding young scientists, 
    outstanding athletes and artists. The school    has consistently reaped 
    awards and citations in local, regional, national and international competitions.
   </p>
   
   <p class="paragraph">
    What may make the school a part from others are its socially relevant programs 
    like Outreach Activities, Immersion and Scout Camps. In these programs, the school 
	develops the totality of the youth, for they are not only academicians but young 
	students who are able to respond to the needs of the society. By the mandate of  R.A 10533,
	also known as the Enhanced Basic Education Act of 2013, the UB Science High 
	School followed its provision of having a six-year secondary education program. 
	With 3 main tracks offered namely, STEM, ABM and HUMSS.
